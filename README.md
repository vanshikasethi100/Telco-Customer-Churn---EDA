# Telco-Customer-Churn---EDA
Performed exploratory analysis on telecom customer data to uncover churn drivers and retention patterns. The study highlights how contract type, service adoption, payment behavior, and tenure influence customer loyalty, enabling clear identification of high-risk segments and actionable strategies for improving retention.
1. Customer Contract Behavior:
-Month-to-month customers show the highest churn, indicating low commitment segments
-Long-term contracts (1-year / 2-year) strongly associated with retention and loyalty

2. Service Usage & Product Adoption:
-Fiber-optic internet users churn significantly more than DSL users
-Absence of Tech Support, Online Security, and Backup services strongly linked to higher churn
-Customers with multiple bundled services demonstrate stable retention behavior

3. Payment & Billing Patterns:
-Electronic check users exhibit the highest churn risk
-Automatic payment methods (credit card / bank transfer) correlate with long-term retention
-Paperless billing users show relatively higher exit tendency

4. Customer Tenure & Engagement:
-New customers (low tenure) are the most vulnerable to churn
-Long-tenure customers display strong stickiness and service dependency

6. Key Business Insight:
-Churn is primarily driven by low commitment + low trust + low service adoption segments
-High retention segments are characterized by contract lock-in, auto-payments, and service bundling

Actionable Takeaway:
-The analysis clearly identifies high-risk customer cohorts and provides strong direction for targeted retention campaigns, onboarding engagement strategies, and value-added service promotion to reduce churn.
